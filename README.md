# DM2024 Lab1 Homework

This repository contains the submission for Lab 1 of the DM2024 course. In this lab, I performed various data preprocessing steps and visualized the results to better understand the data structure. I utilized several data preprocessing methods and conducted data visualization to present the datasetâ€™s features more intuitively. Additionally, I applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as PAMI, UMAP, and PCA, and finally used Naive Bayes Classification along with cosine similarity measures for model training and classification.

## Lab Overview

### Data Preprocessing & Dimensionality Reduction
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Basic cleaning and organization of the dataset.
- **Dimensionality Reduction Methods:**
  - **PAMI:** A method used to reduce the dimensionality of the data (please refer to the source code for detailed implementation).
  - **UMAP:** Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
  - **PCA:** Principal Component Analysis, which extracts major features through linear transformation.

### Visualization
- Various charts were created to display the internal structure and key trends of the data, making it easier to interpret.

### Model Training & Classification
- **Naive Bayes Classification (NB):** Employed for the data classification task.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Used to compute the similarity between different data points, aiding in model training and enhancing classification performance.
